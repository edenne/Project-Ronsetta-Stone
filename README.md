# Project Ronsetta Stone
### Goal
The purpose of Project Ronsetta Stone is to automate the translation the obscure language microlanguage Hansenese.  This process is better known as "Hanslation".

### Approach
Through the use of natural language processing tools and custom language parsing algorithms, we will develop a .NET Hanslation library that can manage
both English -> Hansenese and Hansenese -> English.

The library will be used by the Hanslator Bot, which will accept text input and supply the appropriate Hanslation.

The bot will work in either of two personas:

    RON: The RON persona accepts English input and returns Hansenese

    NOR: The NOR persona accepts Hansenese input and returns English

### Barriers
There is no extant record of spoken Hansenese.  Although the Hanslator Bot will be capable of
speech, the proper phonology remains unknown.
Furthermore, there is no known individual that is fluent in writing both Hansenese
and English.  Therefore, all hanslations should be considered approximate.

### Related Work
The Hanslator will exist in a rich environment, where conversations may be joined by other bots.  For instance:

#### The Governess:
The Governess exists to reprimand, scold, and inhibit productivity.  She never exhibits any meaninful contextual
understanding of the discussion, but will be sure to mire it in heavy process and unecessary drama.

#### The Hoff:
Never hassle the Hoff.  The Hoff will detect process immaturity and explain how it was better managed
in his "previous life".  Similar to his hero, POTUS 45, The Hoff suffers from slow cognition and a limited vocabulary.
